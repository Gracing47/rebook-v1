# ReBook 📚✨

## 🚀 Mind‑blowing Intro
Imagine a world where every book you read becomes a living, breathing source of knowledge—augmented by AI insights and secured by blockchain. **ReBook** lets you **mint insights**, **unlock knowledge**, and **own the data** you generate, all while enjoying a premium, glass‑morphism UI that feels like stepping into the future of reading.

---

## ✅ Phase 1 – Done
- **Celo Mainnet integration** – wallet connections now target the Celo mainnet.
- **Clean, modular code** – shared wallet config, typed `Book` model, and streamlined components.
- **Responsive UI** – premium design with smooth animations, wide‑modal ConnectButton, and a sleek header.
- **Full stack ready** – `npm run dev` launches a working MVP.

## 🚧 Phase 2 – In Progress (AI + NFT Gating)
- ✅ **DeepSeek AI integration** – fast text summarisation with `deepseek-chat` model
- ✅ **AI Summary UI** – floating button in reader with premium modal display
- ✅ **NFT-gated access** – ERC-1155 access pass on Celo Mainnet
- ✅ **Gasless minting** – users claim NFTs with zero gas fees
- ✅ **AI-generated artwork** – unique deterministic patterns for each NFT
- ✅ **MintFlow component** – simple onboarding with name → artwork → mint
- 🔄 **Contract deployment** – needs thirdweb dashboard setup (see `PHASE2_DEPLOYMENT.md`)

---

## ⏭️ Next Steps
- **AI‑driven summarisation** – generate concise insights for each chapter.
- **Token‑gated access** – reward readers with NFTs that unlock premium content.
- **Analytics dashboard** – track reading habits and insight mining metrics.
- **Deploy to production** – CI/CD pipeline, Docker container, and Vercel/Netlify deployment.
- **Community features** – comments, ratings, and collaborative reading groups.
